Project meetes weekly on Monday

11/3/2026 (Monday):
Downloaded LabVIEW Community to program the robot arm
LabVIEW Community / Robot arm does not work with Macbook </3, this task has been given to Dom
Going to try converting the provided LabVIEW code to python for ease of use. If this doesn't work in the next week, I'll switch to something else.
